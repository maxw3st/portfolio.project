Hello World!

This is my portfolio project. 
As I complete new projects, or change old ones, this site and repository will change accordingly.
The idea is to give me version control over projects, as they come along, and a site that is 
expandable.

It will also give me one place that acts as a TOC with links to projects as they accrue. Initially
it will be populated with the various efforts produced from courses at AiPgh, and the "on-my-own-time"
work I've created so far.

Making a change to the file as part of the GitHub tutorial I'm going through.
